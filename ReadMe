Running the File:
    1. make sure you have the python file (.py) and the data (.txt) file saved to your machine
    2. open the terminal
    3. enter the following command:

        python "Your Absolute File Path to AI_8puzzle_solver.py" "Algorithm Choice" "Your Absolute File Path to data file"

            - Algorithm choices = dfs, ids, astar1, astar2
            - NOTE: you may experience errors from the terminal if you don't include the "" around the file paths
            - NOTE: the depth of the state-space tree is set to 10, you can increase this depth to see if the agent can 
                    solve puzzles that are arranged in a more difficult format (requires more moves and searches to reach the goal state).
                    - if you increase the depth too much, your machine may crash or experience errors, I suggest using Google Colab for this reason.

Example Terminal Input:
    WINDOWS:
    python "C:\Users\samue\PycharmProjects\CS4365 AI Projects\AI_8puzzle_solver.py" astar2 "C:\Users\samue\Downloads\8puzzle_infile.txt"

    MAC:
    /usr/local/bin/python3 "/Users/jamie/Downloads/AI_8puzzle_solver.py" dfs "/Users/jamie/Downloads/inputfile.txt"


Example Contents of Input File: 6 7 1 9 8 2 * 5 4 3
    - If you don't have the data file, simply copy/paste those numbers into a .txt file


Example Output:

    Initial Puzzle State:
    6 7 1
    8 2 *
